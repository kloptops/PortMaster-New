    <name>The Ur-Quan Masters</name>
    <desc>The Ur-Quan Masters is a 2002 open source fangame modification, based on the action-adventure science fiction game Star Control II. The original Star Control II was released for the PC in 1992, and ported to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1994. It has been frequently mentioned among the best games of all time, with additional praise for its writing, world design, character design, and music. 
 
After the Star Control II copyrights reverted to creators Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford, they licensed their content to their fan community to keep their series in the public eye. The open source development team was able to remake the 3DO version as a port to modern operating systems. Released under the title The Ur-Quan Masters, the modified remake has since been downloaded nearly two million times, earning critical reception as one of the best free games available, with additional praise for its fan modifications.</desc>
