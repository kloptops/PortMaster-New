    <name>Hijinx - Enhanced Edition</name>
    <desc>Hijinx is a game of pure platforming. There are no enemies to thwart, and no grand quests to complete: just you, the level exit, and an improbable number of spikes on almost every wall between the two.

But it's never that simple: sometimes you can't touch the ground, sometimes gravity is on the fritz, and every so often, the level is filled with coins we nicked from the plumber next door. To win the game, you must collect every card in every level; and before every card is another challenge to complete.

The original Hijinx won first place at the third Godot Wild Jam. The enhanced edition brings with it a complete graphical overhaul, and adds new levels and gameplay mechanics to make a total of thirty cards to collect over ten unique levels, besides numerous other changes.</desc>
