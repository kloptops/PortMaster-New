    <desc>Psebay is an atmospheric adventure in moto trial genre. EXCITING GAMEPLAY WITH DYNAMIC GRAVITY. 'Flying' over the hills and cliffs on a motorbike is surely compelling. But when the ground crumbles under your wheels and the world turns upside down, that's when it becomes really cool!</desc>
