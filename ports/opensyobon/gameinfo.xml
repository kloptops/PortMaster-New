    <desc>Syobon Action, also known as Cat Mario, is a Japanese freeware platform game released in February 2007. It is known for its levels designed to cause extreme rage due to innocuous-looking objects that suddenly kill the character. Though the game is a parody of Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo Entertainment System, it adds elements from other Mario games such as Super Mario World.</desc>
