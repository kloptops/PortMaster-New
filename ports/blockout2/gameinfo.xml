    <desc>BlockOut II is a freeware, open-source remake of a Tetris variant puzzler from 1989, with slight improvements to the graphics and sounds and the option to upload the score to an online table. The gameplay is still the same, where the objective is to move and arrange 3D pieces falling inside a pit seen from above, to create complete layers at the bottom and make them disappear. The pieces can be rotated on all axis to fit in the nooks and crannies available. If the layers accumulate and fill all the space to the top, the game is over. As in the original, the size of the well and the shape of the pieces can be configured in the options menu.</desc>
