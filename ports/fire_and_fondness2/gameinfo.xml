    <desc>Daytime television just got hot: in the hit gameshow, Fire &amp; Fondness, young lovers put their relationships to the test in the ultimate courtship ritual: attempting to navigate a succession of convoluted, flamethrower-filled deathtraps. Our lawyers are advising us to clarify that the fire is fake. As are the teleporters. But the relationships are real! (Probably.) The original Fire &amp; Fondness was the winner of the Godot Community Game Jam 2018. The sequel, which features an original soundtrack, contains thirty-five levels, with new tricks and mechanics around every corner, including a set of super-difficult challenges for expert players. It also has a dog.</desc>
