    <desc>It's morning and you gotta wake up for work, you hear the alarm clocks, but to wake up you need to collect all the clocks and escape the room before deep sleep ghosts catch you. They'll follow your every step and will eventually catch and make you fall into Deep Sleep if you're not careful. Use your Dream Pillow to traverse through 15 different and challenging levels! Good luck!</desc>
