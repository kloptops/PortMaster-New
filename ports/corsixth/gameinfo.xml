    <name>Theme Hospital</name>
    <desc>Theme Hospital is a level-based hospital management simulation where players have to start on an empty building, and then assemble rooms with all kinds of material, from desks and file cabinets for the general diagnosis to the expensive ultra-scanners and X-rays to diagnose such bizarre diseases as Bloaty Head, Slack Songue or Alien DNA, and treat them with even more bizarre machines like an Head Inflator or a DNA fixer. There are several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors.</desc>
