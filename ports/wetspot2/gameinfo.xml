    <desc>The arcade game WetSpot 2 is similar to older versions of Pengo and Bubble Bobble. Up to two people can play simultaneously while controlling a little crab through a series of mazes. In order to advance to the next level, you must eliminate all the monsters on the current one. Since you lack weapons, you must use the same bricks that make up the level's walls in order to achieve your objective. How? Simply approach a brick and press the fire button; the brick in front of you will start to move in that direction and halt only when it collides with another brick.</desc>
