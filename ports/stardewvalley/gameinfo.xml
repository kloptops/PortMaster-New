    <desc>Stardew Valley is an RPG inspired by the Harvest Moon games where you play as the inheritor of an old farm in a small town called Stardew Valley. Leaving the taxing big city life behind, you embark upon a quest to restore the neglected tract through dedication and hard work. 
 
The gameplay consists of keeping the plot of land clean from decaying plants, stones, logs and stumps, planting and fostering new vegetation, discovering new places, combating hostile animals and monsters, earning money and collecting materials in order to create new tools and buildings, joining in social activities and events, befriending and romancing non-playable characters, all while managing the protagonist's energy levels. 
 
There are multiple subplots which the player may choose to impact, for example, one may choose to hinder or help Joja Corporation in outselling smaller businesses in order to control and renew the town which would rid it of its traditions. The game is an open-ended one and there is no official ending. The content changes often as it being updated regularly based on player feedback.</desc>
