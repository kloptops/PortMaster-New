    <name>Caesar III</name>
    <desc>As a provincial governor charged with spreading the glory of Rome our mission is clear: build cities, foster trade and industry, make money. How you accomplish this is entirely up to you. Gain wealth and power, make a career out of pleasing the emperor, battle Barbarians and repel invaders or concentrate on building the next Eternal City. Fail and youâ€™ll end up as lunch for the lions. Prove your strength of mind and spirit and you just may be crowned Caesar!</desc>
