    <name>Oddworld - Abe's Exoddus</name>
    <desc>Those nasty Glukons are at it again, intent on oppressing the loveable Mudokons any way they can. Last time, the meanies were manufacturing Mudokon jerky. Now, they've officially taken genocide too far, by forcing blind Mudokons into slave labor to dig up the bones of their fellow deceased. It so happens, by the way, that Mudokon bones add just the right kick to a favorite Glukon recipe, Soulstorm Brew.
 Who's gonna save the day? Our unlikely hero Abe, of course. You remember Abe: that blue-green, loincloth-wearing, six foot-tall Fraggle with chronic digestive problems? Yep, he would have been content to rest on his laurels after rescuing ninety-nine of his Mudokon buddies from extermination in Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, but a group of disgruntled ghosts elected good ol' Abe to avenge their deaths.</desc>

    <name>Oddworld - Abe's Oddysee</name>
    <desc>Abe's Oddysee begins with the eponymous protagonist as a prisoner in RuptureFarms, from which he narrates his story. He and many other Mudokons are slaves to Molluck the Glukkon, the owner of RuptureFarms: "the biggest meat-processing plant on Oddworld". Abe is a contented floor-waxer First Class and currently Employee of the Year.

At the time of the story, the ingredients of the corporation's three major "Tasty Treats" (Scrab Cakes, Paramite Pies, and Meech Munchies) are quickly running out, with the Meeches already extinct. While working late, Abe overhears Molluck's plan to use the Mudokon slaves as meat products called "Mudokon Pops!", which frightens Abe into escaping from the factory.</desc>
