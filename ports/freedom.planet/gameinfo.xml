    <desc>Freedom Planet is a 2D platformer whose gameplay is based on several Sega Genesis-era games, including Sonic the Hedgehog and Gunstar Heroes. The player may choose which heroine to use, and each has her own abilities and exclusive stages to conquer. Lilac can run at high speeds and defeat enemies with her melee attacks. Carol uses her martial arts skills to fight, and uses both her wall-jumping abilities and motorcycle to get from place to place. Lastly, Milla can create shields with her psychic powers, throw items, and float to distant platforms. 
 
The game features a story-based Adventure mode, a purely gameplay-based Classic mode, and a Time Attack mode. Speedrunning is both supported and encouraged, including achievements for beating specified times for each stage.</desc>
