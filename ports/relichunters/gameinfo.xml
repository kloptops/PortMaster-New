    <desc>Relic Hunters Zero: Remix is a remaster of the 1 million player hit game that takes the adventure and levels it up in more ways than one! Follow your heroes: Jimmy, Pinkyy, Ace, Panzer, Biu, Raff, and Red as they explore, looking for relics while trying to get the Ducans off their Asteroid. Run, Gun, and Dodge your way through numerous space ducks and evil space turtles. It’s fast, it’s tactical, and it feels deliciously smooth to play. Unlock new weapons, characters and use relics to overcome waves of enemies to ultimately defeat Duke, The Ducan Commander!</desc>
