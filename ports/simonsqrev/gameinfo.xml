    <name>Castlevania II - Simon's Quest Revamped</name>
    <desc>Complete revision of Nintendo's legendary Castlevania. Castlevania II: Simon Quest Revamped is a 2D platform role-playing game where you will be in control of famous vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who is trying to end the tyranny of Count Dracula one last time.

As its name implies, this version of the game revisits the classic Castlevania II: Simon Quest which first appeared on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Graphically, they've cleaned the game up quite a bit to look like a 16-bit game, and they've added tons of other new features, like a save function and a better menu system.

The game itself boasts many improvements on its original version. Jumping, for example, is much more fluid and precise; even the combat system is more exact and enjoyable. There is also a good variety of enemies that have been recreated, which really gives a boost to combat, compared to earlier titles.</desc>
