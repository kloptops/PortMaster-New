    <desc>This stand-alone sequel to Redneck Rampage finds Leonard and Bubba shooting their way back to Hickston after crash-landing the UFO at the end of the first game.  Using the same engine and most of the same graphics as the original, RRRA adds vehicles, some new weapons (including a sling blade), new alien clones (a Dennis Hopper-ish biker and an evil cheerleader), and fourteen levels of ass-whuppin'.
