    <desc>Serious Sam: The First Encounter is a remake of Serious Sam: The First Encounter. The entire game starting from the story over the levels with their secrets, monsters, weapons and power-ups remain entirely the same as in the original game but everything has been graphically enhanced through the use of the Serious Engine 3. 
 
Sam is send back in time to prevent the destruction of mankind in the 21st Century by an alien known as Mental. But ancient Egypt isn't as we were told. Instead hundreds and hundreds of Mental's minions including the now famous Beheaded Bomber, several kinds of Bio-Mechanoids and Lava Golems lurk around the pyramids and ancient cities or get teleported there once Sam enters a certain area or triggers a script in the linear levels.</desc>
