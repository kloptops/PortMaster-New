    <name>Out of Ammo</name>
    <desc>A mix of retro shmup (think Judgement Silversword) and breakout, in the style of something like The Lost Shield or Wizorb, with aesthetics hugely inspired by ZeroRanger (because it's brilliant, and green+orange goes well with EVERYTHING). Eliminating priority enemies/bosses is all that's needed to progress, instead of each stage dragging on until every last stationary helpless block is vanquished. Also, there are bonus objectives in some stages.</desc>
