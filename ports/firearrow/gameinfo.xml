    <desc>Fire Arrow is a short time attack "coffee break" shoot 'em up with randomized enemies and adaptive difficulty. There are two different modes - 3 minutes and 5 minutes - and two ships to choose from, tackling a single stage shooting for a high-score. Ships can be toggled by the press of a button, serving as alternate fire modes and you also have the usual handful of bombs. Other than the basic shot power-up, destroyed enemies drop medals to pick up for extra score.</desc>
